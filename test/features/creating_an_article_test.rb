# Creating a post
#   Given that I'm logged in as "Josh"
#   I go to "/" and click "New Post"
#   Now I'm on "/posts/new"
#   I enter a title of "My latest thoughts"
#   I enter a body of  "Some like it hot, some like it cold, some like it in the pot 9 days old"
#   I click "Submit"
#   I am now on "/posts/124-my-latest-thoughts"
#   And I see the title is "My latest thoughts"
#   And I see the body is "Some like it hot, some like it cold, some like it in the pot 9 days old"
#   I go to "/" and see that my post is listed at the top of the list of posts
